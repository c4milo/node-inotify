# node-inotify - monitoring file system events in Gnu/Linux with [NodeJS][nodejs_home]
The inotify API provides a mechanism for monitoring file system events.
Inotify can be used to monitor individual files, or to monitor directories.
When a directory is monitored, inotify will return events for the directory
itself, and for files inside the directory. [(ref: GNU/Linux Manual)][inotify.7]

## Installation
[NodeJS][nodejs_dev] versions 0.8.x are currently supported and tested.

### Install from NPM (Easy way)
    $ npm install inotify

### Install from git
    $ npm install node-gyp -g
    $ git clone git://github.com/c4milo/node-inotify.git
    $ cd node-inotify
    $ node-gyp rebuild

## API
  * `var inotify = new Inotify()`: Create a new instance of Inotify. By default it's in persistent mode.
  You can specify `false` in `var inotify = new Inotify(false)` to use the non persistent mode.

  * `var wd = inotify.addWatch(arg)`:  Add a watch for files or directories. This will then return a watch descriptor. The argument is an object as follows
        var arg = { path: 'path to be monitored',
                    watch_for: an optional OR'ed set of events to watch for.
                               If they're not specified, it will use
                               Inotify.IN_ALL_EVENTS by default,
                    callback: Callback function that will receive each event.
        }
You can call this function as many times as you want to monitor different paths.
**Inotify monitoring of directories is not recursive**: to monitor subdirectories
under a directory, additional watches must be created.

  * `inotify.removeWatch(watch_descriptor)`: Remove a watch associated with the watch_descriptor param and returns `true` if the action was succesful or `false` in the opposite case. Removing a watch cause an `Inotify.IN_IGNORED` event to be generated for this watch descriptor.

  * `inotify.close()`: Remove all the watches and close the inotify's file descriptor. Returns `true` if the action was succesful or false in the opposite case.

### Event object structure
```javascript
    var event = {   watch: Watch descriptor,
                    mask: Mask of events,
                    cookie: Cookie that permits to associate events,
                    name: Optional name of the object being watched
                };
```

The `event.name` property is only present when an event is returned for a file inside a
watched directory; it identifies the file pathname relative to the watched
directory.


## Example of use

```javascript
    var Inotify = require('inotify').Inotify;
    var inotify = new Inotify(); //persistent by default, new Inotify(false) //no persistent

    var data = {}; //used to correlate two events

    var callback = function(event) {
        var mask = event.mask;
        var type = mask & Inotify.IN_ISDIR ? 'directory ' : 'file ';
        event.name ? type += ' ' + event.name + ' ': ' ';

        //the porpuse of this hell of 'if'
        //statements is only illustrative.

        if(mask & Inotify.IN_ACCESS) {
            console.log(type + 'was accessed ');
        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_MODIFY) {
            console.log(type + 'was modified ');
        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_OPEN) {
            console.log(type + 'was opened ');
        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE) {
            console.log(type + ' opened for reading was closed ');
        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_CLOSE_WRITE) {
            console.log(type + ' opened for writing was closed ');
        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_ATTRIB) {
            console.log(type + 'metadata changed ');
        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_CREATE) {
            console.log(type + 'created');
        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_DELETE) {
            console.log(type + 'deleted');
        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_DELETE_SELF) {
            console.log(type + 'watched deleted ');
        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_MOVE_SELF) {
            console.log(type + 'watched moved');
        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_IGNORED) {
            console.log(type + 'watch was removed');
        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_MOVED_FROM) {
            data = event;
            data.type = type;
        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_MOVED_TO) {
            if( Object.keys(data).length &&
                data.cookie === event.cookie) {
                console.log(type + ' moved to ' + data.type);
                data = {};
            }
        }
    }
    var home_dir = { path:      '/home/camilo', // <--- change this for a valid directory in your machine.
                     watch_for: Inotify.IN_OPEN | Inotify.IN_CLOSE,
                     callback:  callback
                  };

    var home_watch_descriptor = inotify.addWatch(home_dir);

    var home2_dir = { path:      '/home/bob', // <--- change this for a valid directory in your machine
                      watch_for: Inotify.IN_ALL_EVENTS,
                      callback:  callback
                  };

    var home2_wd = inotify.addWatch(home2_dir);

```

## Inotify Events

### Watch for:
 * **Inotify.IN_ACCESS:** File was accessed (read)
 * **Inotify.IN_ATTRIB:** Metadata changed, e.g., permissions, timestamps, extended attributes, link count (since Linux 2.6.25), UID, GID, etc.
 * **Inotify.IN_CLOSE_WRITE:** File opened for writing was closed
 * **Inotify.IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE:** File not opened for writing was closed
 * **Inotify.IN_CREATE:** File/directory created in the watched directory
 * **Inotify.IN_DELETE:** File/directory deleted from the watched directory
 * **Inotify.IN_DELETE_SELF:** Watched file/directory was deleted
 * **Inotify.IN_MODIFY:** File was modified
 * **Inotify.IN_MOVE_SELF:** Watched file/directory was moved
 * **Inotify.IN_MOVED_FROM:** File moved out of the watched directory
 * **Inotify.IN_MOVED_TO:** File moved into watched directory
 * **Inotify.IN_OPEN:** File was opened
 * **Inotify.IN_ALL_EVENTS:** Watch for all kind of events
 * **Inotify.IN_CLOSE:**  (IN_CLOSE_WRITE | IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE)  Close
 * **Inotify.IN_MOVE:**  (IN_MOVED_FROM | IN_MOVED_TO)  Moves

### Additional Flags:
 * **Inotify.IN_ONLYDIR:** Only watch the path if it is a directory.
 * **Inotify.IN_DONT_FOLLOW:** Do not follow symbolics links
 * **Inotify.IN_ONESHOT:** Only send events once
 * **Inotify.IN_MASK_ADD:** Add (OR) events to watch mask for this pathname if it already exists (instead of replacing the mask).

### The following bits may be set in the `event.mask` property returned in the callback
 * **Inotify.IN_IGNORED:** Watch was removed explicitly with inotify.removeWatch(watch_descriptor) or automatically (the file was deleted, or the file system was unmounted)
 * **Inotify.IN_ISDIR:** Subject of this event is a directory
 * **Inotify.IN_Q_OVERFLOW:** Event queue overflowed (wd is -1 for this event)
 * **Inotify.IN_UNMOUNT:** File system containing the watched object was unmounted
